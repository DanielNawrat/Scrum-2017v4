Consequently, dividing it between everyone and relinquishing, when someone else still got no water, was taken for granted. Except for Scorpius. He refused to share his water and started to manipulate other ones to do the same. This reckless behaviour culminates in his decision to construct an underground system which blocks all of our water sources, so we can not draw on them anymore. The only one that still gave water, was the one in his new built palace, deep in the north. There was and there is no chance to burgle. His guardians are doing their job very well. Since that day, he comes to Siccum every week and forces us to fight for our water. If you win, you will get two full keg of water. If you lose... you have to try to survive one week without new water. And everyone who is trying to steal it or to trick him, is going to prison. Immediately. So.

There's more to this planet than ash clouds, lava and rocky landscape if you use your knowledge and cleverness. On the western side you see massives waves detonating on the shores. You turn around and you see a vastland of volcanoes, mountains and dry land. This must be the vast landscape of Geysiria. First I try to explain the map a little - sorry, I don't know everything, but I think I can give you some hints I know from King Kamehameha. Here are your options, respectively the options I know: On the horizon, in the east, there is your landing zone, where you normally land. You landed a little more west on a steep cliff but you were lucky, the spaceship is still in one piece. Here you can either head north on the Kamehameha Route to the North Shore to hopefully reach the big area where all the infamous geysirs are. Your second option is heading towards the little village which is in the eastern part of the planet. You can explore the region of all the volcanoes here. To this point I don't know much more. Keep me updated and I will try and connect the dots at the next stops."

Instead of going nowhere from the Spaceship_Geysiria, say "The key to leave the spaceship is going south. If you stand in the exit already - you will need to head east as you stand on the edge of cliff where only going east will make sense."

[Room Descritions]
The description of the Coastway is "A very famous route you are walking on. A century ago King Kamehameha ventured along this very tiny path you can barely see anymore. He made this entire path for about two hundred kilometers until Hale'iwa, a little spot on the northern Shores of Geysiria. This little spot is called after a bird that is living there. It is a little outlook nestled in a vast land where you can overlook the whole North Shore. The windward west side, the eastern side where many land mines lay below the ground and the ocean is what you can see here."

The description of the Seaside is "The final point where King Kamehameha landed back when you weren't existing. This is actually the last location where King Kamehameha was known to be alive. He built his Ho'kulea and set sail to reach another planet. His return to his home planet should be very soon but he never came back. By the looks of the ocean I'm not too sure if he made it behind the outer reefs. It is a very dangerous place and I recommend to stay out of the water. Or are you keen enough to set sail to the next planet? I don't think so."

The description of the Geysir_Area is "Whooooosh, whoooosh - Geysirs everywhere. Massive chambers of lava stone push enormous water massses into the air - what a breathtaking phenomenon! You have been hiking for hours with only a few liters of fresh water. The way was very long and hard, the dangers of falling and getting caught by monstrous waves were contstant. But you made it. Congratulations. So what next? First, you should drink as much as you can, some Geysirs here have fresh drinking water, some are saltwater. You will find out pretty quickly. Now it's time to to get serious. How long can you rest on this planet? Think quick and choose your options wisely. Did you find the underwater map of the underwater volcano system in the spaceship? If yes, you will find the heart of the volcano with the help of this map. Otherwise, you will have to choose another option..."

The description of the Underwater_Cave is "The infamous Pu'ulau Cave - no one has ever been here before. Many have had the underwater map, but congratulations again, you are the first one to ever connect the dots and find the right way into this little and very complex underwater system. Do you see the black hole at the end? This is the heart of the volcano. If you reach it before lava comes out - you will destroy every volcano on this planet and you can head back to your spaceship to leave the extincted area."

The description of the Mine_Area is "People say there are some land mines still in this area. You can go back to the Landing Zone and try another way. In order to master the Kamehameha Route which only King Kamehameha passed a few hundred years ago you need some tools to get access to the Seaside. Be patient, calm and collected and make good choices. You would be the second one to master this way full of obstacles."

The description of Underwater_CaveHeart is "This is your last step to finally stop all the ash clouds and the constant lava flow above ground. The underwater system map lead you here - you should make use of your one and only tool that will fit into the little heart that is at the end of this tiny corridor. May Geysiria rest in peace."



[Restrictions]
Instead of going nowhere from the Coastway, say "Stay on track. In the east there is an area full of land mines. People don't call it [italic type] Field of Death [Roman type] for no reason but a land mine could be useful as there are a lot of rocks and obstacles on the Kamehameha Route."

[Objects]
The land mine is an object in the Mine_Area. 
Before going to the Seaside:
	unless player carries land mine:
		move the player to the Mine_Area;
		say "Take the land mine.";
		stop the action.

The massive rock is door. 
The massive rock is north of the Coastway.
The massive rock is south of the Seaside. 
Detonate is an action applying to nothing.
Understand "Detonate" as detonate. 

[Before going to the Seaside:
	unless player detonate:
		move the player to the Coastway;
		say "You'll need something to destroy this massive pile of rocks in front of you. Isn't there an area on your way that has the right tools on offer?";
		stop the action.]



Instead of going nowhere from the Seaside, say "The North Shore of Geysiria is known for its massive outer reef waves. The Hokule'a boats tried to pass the shorebreaks and outer reef bombs but as you know, they have never been seen again. You can take a short break and watch the waves and breathe some clean ocean air - but I guess that's pretty much all you can do here... The windward side is the roughest. There are not many animals on this planet - to be honest, there are about six species living here. Five are not dangerous and only active at night, you won't see any of them. But the mountain lion only living on the windward west side of the planet is dangerous as it is very calm and collected. It's like the Great White Shark. Once you see it, it's too late. Please turn around, the east side is much more welcoming."

Instead of going nowhere from the Geysir_Area, say "The Geysir Area is the last thing you will see on the eastern side of the planet. Passing a few hundred Geysirs to just see the ocean behind them is not really promising I guess. Take your time and watch this beautiful water spectacle. You can always go back - but as you know the Kamehameha Walk from the Landing Zone over the North Shore to the Geysir Chambers is not the nicest way, always keep that in mind. But if you have no other way back to the spaceship, go for it."

Instead of going nowhere from the Underwater_Cave, say "Try and find the heart of the Volcano or leave it, if you don't have any clue on how to get to the heart of the volcano. The map will help you but without the map you will not find the heart. I know it must be frustrating after the long journey but you better leave the Cave if you left the map in the spaceship - you save time, energy and you can return to the Geysir Chambers to fill up your bottles with fresh drinking water to make your way back on the Kamehameha trail. I hope you make it."

[Room Descriptions]
The description of Volcanoway is "The well known Pe'ahi Trail, better known as Jaws is a nerv-wracking trail with lots of ups and downs - you will walk for hours eventhough the walk itself is only a few kilometers long. On this part of the planet the temperature at day is around 35 to 40 degrees celcius, so you might want to hike in the early hours, in the evening or even at night. In the night time you will see a few animals but they are shy and you won't see many anyway. But if you do, say hi and be happy about some company eventhough the animals don't speak your language."

The description of Volcano is "Very high, very bad sight and dangerous drop-offs characterize the Haiku Volcano. Many centruies ago this volcano area has been formed and Haiku Volcano is the highest one. Imagine the power that has been set free in that eruption. This must have been a massive spectacke. Ah, yeah and you can climb that infamous volcano - if it's not too cloudy you will have a great view over... well... wasteland. You know it, only deserted landscape without much more. But anyway, standing on top something is cool isn't it? Decide for yourself if it's worth the hassle."

The description of Volcano_VillageSquare is "A little Village called Lihue nestled in - oh wonder - deserted landscape. Lihue is a ghost town. Many thousand years ago this little town used was rich because of a gold rush. It only took a few years until the little village turned into a ghost town as the gold rush didn't take very long. You have many houses you can look into and search for some hints in order to leave this planet as soon as possible. Stroll around, here are a few spots you should definitely check out. There is an interesting old building right next to the big market place - you will probably need a special key to open the doors there... Around the place there are lots of other buildings, the house of the mayor with a huge amount of old files and many hidden treasure boxes, a little hut where they used to sell weed and a little chapel which kind of looks a bit intimidating."

The description of Volcano_VillageChapel is "Tons of figures you know from the bible and other holy papers are exhibited here. No one knows why, maybe they explain the gold rush where people from all over the galaxy flocked to this particular place. Some seemed to be very religious and brought some belongings along with them. The ceiling is a little bit demolished but the chapel as a whole doesn't look too bad actually. It's quite an intimidating place because there is not a soul in sight and the pictures on the wall have angry faces everywhere. In the corner where the confessional box is there is an arsenal of a few old weapons including swords and a dagger. The dagger might help you as it has a volcano engraved. The coffin under the altar contains something you will need for sure. Somewhere in the little Village there is a hidden key for that particular coffin. Go search for that key and come back later."
The printed name of Volcano_VillageChapel is "The Old Chapel".

The description of Volcano_VillageWeedhut is "You are standing in front of a little hut, there is not much here except a little toolbox. Back in the day they used to sell weed here as it was legal. The only thing the inhabitants of the village didn't know was the fact that the owners of the little hut regularly stole from the Lihue people. That's the reason why you see this little picklock on top of every other tool. Who needs a grinder, some lamps and spades when you have a picklock that opens any door and makes you rich while other people sleep? Take it and make use of it."
The printed name of Volcano_VillageWeedhut is "The Blunt Box".

The description of Volcano_VillageOldbuilding is "I'm not sure why this building is still standing. It is huge, very old and it seems to crack down the very next moment. But there is something special about this building. The beautiful, embellished doors and the oil paintings on the crumbled walls. The owner of this house was rich, he found out that the rivers - that are now dried up - were full of gold. He quickly became a millionaire but was shot in a fight with one of the gangs who tried to control the gold rush. Since then his wife lived there alone, she was a respected member of the community and nobody wanted to mess with her. She has a little treasure box in her office room (which used to be his office room). The legend says no one ever opened this little treasure box. You are the lucky one to finally open the magic doors. Now you can open the treasure box and look what the rumour is all about."
The printed name of Volcano_VillageOldbuilding is "The Gold House".

The description of Volcano_VillageMayorhouse is "The house where the mayor lived. Some say he was a good mayor, some others say he was corrupt, an alcoholic and he had a feed of clay for cocaine. But there is no proof. Maybe you find a cocaine line somewhere but I guess it is too late for you to play detective. You better check the surroundings in this house in order to find something you really need."
The printed name of Volcano_VillageMayorhouse is "The Mayor Mansion".

After examining Old Building:
	say "Look into old building and check your surroundings. Do you have the map that is supposed to be in the spaceship? Did you forget it? The old building has a few maps of Geysiria - I'm not too sure if there is one of the underwater system but since you only have a few buildings with easy access you should consider checking it out. So many folders in those massive shelves. Take the ladder to your right and search through every map folder here - maybe you're lucky and find a copy of that particular underwater system map. You already found the treasure box, so why shouldn't you be able to find the map you need.".
	
[Water dagger kann noch nicht in Herz des Vulkans gerammt werden]
	
The water dagger hole is a container in the Underwater_CaveHeart.

After inserting the water dagger into the Underwater_CaveHeart:
	say "Boooooooooom. Explosions everywhere. Luckily you are under the ground and everything you feel is just a little earthquake. The good thing is your spaceship is in the west of the island and the exploding volcanoes are here in the east. Lava, falling rocks and huge ash clouds turn Geysiria into hell. It takes a few hours to let the volcanoes disappear... I know, you are not very patient Axesto but it's better to wait until the last volcano is destroyed. [italic type] Sixteen hours later... [Roman type] Now it's time to head back to the spaceship on the western side of the planet and leave the planet as soon as possible. You are starting the engine and the spaceship is flying high above the wasteland that is Geysiria now. Wow, finally you can see this vast landscape from above. No ashclouds, nothing. A totally clear view of the planet that let you struggle so much. But in the end it was worth it. A quick look onto your planet map says the next stop will be Frizza. Hmmm, Frizza, it sounds a little freezing, doesn't it? You have a few hundred more hours to fly through the galaxy, so turn on the auto pilot and get some rest. The days on Geysiria were tough. Axesto is sleeping like a little child on the locker between some folders and some first aid kits. [Italic type] Three days later, Axesto finally sees the Flux which must be the Flux of Frizza. [Roman type]. [paragraph break]Chapter 4 - Frizza[paragraph break]Frizza looks like a monstrous black rock, nothing more. Is this really the planet you are supposed to land on? Yes, you have to land on Frizza because your little fusion reactor is working slower than before. It's an old one you got on Fidartis. This planet is not known to produce the best technology. So you better try to land safely on Frizza. This turns out to be an extreme adventure as you end up in a massive thunderstorm. But that's not a problemm for you - you are the most experienced spaceship commander in the whole galaxy. Without any noise you land smoothly on Frizza. Your first impression from many kilometers away are confirmed: it looks very unfriendly and actually uninhabited too. Maybe you should talk to your on-board computer first, there may be a few hints that will help you to explore Frizza. I heard it's supposed to be a planet with a lot of potential. Have fun."

"Welcome to the only village on the island. Many thousand years ago native Geysirians used to live here. I really have no idea how they survived for almost two decades with no food and only very few spring water sources. But they did - these are the remaining houses and some shipwrecks. The Geysirians used to be good fishermen and were brave enough to wait for a set pause and skip the massive shore on the eastern and western shores of Geysiria. Many of them died trying to survive - that's the reason Geysiria Village is now a ghost town. But you are clever, maybe you'll find a helpful tool to leave this village and the planet as soon as possible."

[Story]

	
When play begins:
	 say 
"Your ship falls through thick layers of dark clouds. Red flashes illuminate your surroundings. The lights on your console warn you of the dangerously fast approaching energy level zero. As you finally break through the last cloud, you get a glimpse of what awaits you underneath. [line break]Black planes and sharp cliffs of a dark red shape the landscape. In the [bold type]east [roman type]you perceive a massive rock formation, in the [bold type]west [roman type]you see a thick blue stream cutting through the plane , illuminating big portions of it in the process. Somewhere to the [bold type]south [roman type]there seem to be some sort of industrial constructions, far in the [bold type]north [roman type]you believe to recognize cubic shapes that reveal a city. You don't have time to study the landscape much longer. All you concentration is desperately needed as you find a gap in the ghastly cliffs and bring down your ship. Heavy jolting, followed by a sudden blow signalize your landing. [line break]Your ship's on the ground, and you are too, barely. Welcome to Frizza.";

Where they touch the surface, you believe to see tiny, interlinked pulses of blue light, like a neural system, but you can't be sure. [paragraph break]As you study the console, the two operators become aware of you, freezing in their motion and watching you suspiciously.[paragraph break]Anyhow, you could [bold type]examine[roman type] the console further."

Before examining the console for the second time:

[Asking Operators]

You must have a rather puzzled look to your face, as Du'un starts to explain soon after. [paragraph break][italic type]That is a Flux Extractor, the Techies call them 'Scoops'. It is used to extract small portions of the Flux and isolate it for examination. If you want to help us out, showing us that you have no evil intent in the process, go and extract two samples of the Flux, one from the current before it passes through this gate, and one after it has done so. I am sure you will find the proper locations for this purpose yourself. When you are done or have any questions, return here, Dunia will be to your assistance.[paragraph break][roman type]You receive a [bold type]Flux Extractor[roman type].[paragraph break][roman type]With that, Du'un goes off, quickly descending the stairs at the back of the hall.

At least it makes for a show.[paragraph break]"	
"Techies"	"[if Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza][italic type]They were settler's, originally. Sadly they chose to defile the Flux with their robots and devices, hence their nickname. We are not at good terms at the moment, our 'Leader' Kollock even is bitterly hostile towards them, as he sees them as heretics.[paragraph break][otherwise if Dunia is in the Flux Core_Frizza][italic type]They were settler's, originally. Sadly they chose to defile the Flux with their robots and devices, hence their nickname. It has been a long time since any of them saw what is going on below the surface - we won't let them, anymore, and the Flux won't either.[paragraph break]"
"Kollock"	"[if Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza][italic type]Our spiritual leader. Celebrated as god-king. 'He is master, he is Flux'.[paragraph break][roman type]Her tone seems to you tinged with a trace of sarcasm. She looks around, as if to see if nobody is within earshot.[paragraph break][italic type]Though some appreciate their freedom more than others.[paragraph break][otherwise if Dunia is in the Flux Core_Frizza][italic type]Our spiritual leader. Celebrated as god-king. 'He is master, he is Flux'. He is a bollocks if you ask me. Look around you. Nobody has the power to control the force of nature.[paragraph break]"
"Du'un"	"[if Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza][italic type]My father and the Keeper of the Flux, if you didn't notice. He taught me to keep an open mind for things, even if his own mental flexibility starts to crumble at the moment.[paragraph break][otherwise if Dunia is in the Flux Core_Frizza][italic type]My father and the Keeper of the Flux, if you didn't notice. He is responisble for all this down here. If someone has some sort of handle over this, it is him.[paragraph break]"
"Duju"	"[if Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza][italic type]Our people. We have lived on this surface as long as we remember, and that indeed is a long time. We never were the star-seeking sort, due to our connection to the Fluxes.

We have lived on this surface as long as we remember, and that indeed is a long time. The Flux fuels us, it is part of us.

"Orb"	"[if Dunia is in the Flux Core_Frizza][italic type]Pulsing, pumping, central in a sheltered place - does that remind you of something? Yes, it is exactly that.[paragraph break]"
"Cavern"	"[if Dunia is in the Flux Core_Frizza][italic type]Honestly, I don't know where it came from or who built it. Our belief says we originated in this lake down there, could be absurd enough to be true, if you ask me.

A Miserable Lever is in the Underground Flux_Frizza. The description of it is "Really not that glamourous, but it will serve."

Quickly, you extend the Extractor into the Flux and try to keep your fluttering mind together, while hearing the beeping sound. Shorty, you have visions of a brute Duju, clad in plates of thick metal, thorns protruding from the shoulders. Then a lean figure, wrapped in a long black robe, operating some sort of complex device in front of what seems to you like an altar. A penetrating beeping draws you out of your sight. The Extractor is finished. You scramble up to the shore and quickly bring some distance between you and the Flux, your mind and body slowly regaining their place.

[With both Essences]
The description of the unregulated Flux Essence is "A small orb of blue fluid, billowing inside the Extractor. It seems like it would want to sputter, but it is tightly held in place by its chamber."
The description of the regulated Flux Essence is "A small phosphorescent orb, emitting blue light. Its surface is even, there are no whirling drifts, it looks balanced."


After asking Dunia about "Flux Essence":
	if the Regulated Flux Essence is in the Flux Extractor:
		if the Unregulated Flux Essence is in the Flux Extractor:
			say "[italic type]I see you have the two samples. Impressive ... Wait here for a moment.[paragraph break][roman type]She disappears and soon returns with the massive Keeper Du'un. Again you hear the booming of his voice.[paragraph break][italic type]Indeed, he returned. What a cheerful message.[paragraph break][roman type]He seems to be smiling, but even this gesture becomes a little intimidating, considering his imposing build.[paragraph break][italic type]Well then, I think you earned an adequate amount of what you could call trust. Let me show you something.[paragraph break][roman type]He gently but insistingly points you the way - down the stairs which you have so often seen disappear him in. The opening leads to a rather broad tunnel, lined with blue torches on either side. Curiously but not quite voluntarily you enter the tunnel and proceed to step down the stairs into the darkness, the two Duju right behin you. You descend in silence for a long time . At some point, Dunia briefly raises her voice.[paragraph break][italic type]No one other than our people have seen what you will see. I guess one seeks the aspiring relief of someone not involved on either part after such a long time of disappointment.[paragraph break][roman type]Her voice subsides. You hear a soft rumbling from Du'un.[paragraph break][italic type]One might.[paragraph break][roman type]The echos of the exchange are the last vocal sounds you hear for quite some time. You continue to pass fairly large holes in the tunnel, revealing peeks into great caves, deep ravines and cascades of Flux. Later - you really couldn't tell how long you walked - the tunnel broadens and finally leads to an opening. The view takes your breath as you step into a vast cavern. You are surrounded by a natural basin, filled to a considerable level with bluish liquid. In the middle of the cave you see a physically impossible spectacle: There, in mid air, a large blue orb is flying, constantly producing waves of fluid, which then drop down into the basin, keeping the lake's surface in motion. You realize that the air is shimmering, despite the cold atmosphere. You gaze at the grand orb, when your vision suddenly becomes grainy and parts of it fold, spawning shadows and bright specks where there should be none. You close your eyes and look to the ground, as you open them again your vision returned to normal. The Keeper raises his voice. [paragraph break][italic type]Don't let your gaze be caught, or the Flux will consume it. But don't worry, that would have taken a bit longer.[paragraph break][roman type]That warning could have come earlier.[paragraph break]You further decend, approaching the big blue lake, when you become aware of a small stone plateau with the stairwell winding around it. Carefully you follow the two Duju down the last steps to the plateau, in the middle of which a small pond of Flux has gathered. Welcome to the core.";
			say "Du'un comments your arrival.[paragraph break][italic type]That is the core of our Flux. It is the quintessence. Our very being.";

Instead of going up from the Flux Core_Frizza:
	say "You wouldn't want to go up without the Duju, who knows what awaits you."
	
The description of the Flux Core_Frizza is "A huge cavern with a Flux lake at its bottom and a spectacular orb flowing midair, emitting Flux waves. You can't see the tunnel from which you came from. In the middle of the plateau is a small lake, sparkling with a pure sheen. " 

[Energy Orb is an object in the Flux Core_Frizza.]
The Essence Pool is a container in the Flux Core_Frizza. The Essence Pool is scenery. The description of it is "A small bluish lake, its surface entirely still, sparkling with a pure sheen."

The Pure Flux Essence is in the Sanctuary_Frizza.

Table of Du'un Responses 
Topic	Response
"Flux" 	"[italic type]The mighty soul of this planet. Unfortunately, not everybode recognizes its holy nature.[paragraph break]"	
"Techies"	"[italic type]Formerly they were interested people, open to our culture and mind. That changed when the corporations came, and with them the money. They don't look left or right now, which makes them ignorant to the Flux, and dangerous for us. You might understand our prepossession towards them.[paragraph break]"
"Kollock"	"[italic type]Let him be blessed. Father of Duju. Father of Flux.[paragraph break][roman type]You hear nothing of serious approval in his voice, it sounds mechanical. His eyes are ice cold while saying the words.[paragraph break]"
"Dunia"	"[italic type]An ambitious child of a disrupted time. I would not call that bad, though. The most powerful beings emerge in times of conflict.[paragraph break]"
"Duju"	"[italic type]My people, and the most important thing on this planet - speaking as the Keeper. The Flux is us, you know that, thus I guard the Flux like I guard my very own flesh and blood.[paragraph break]"
"Orb"	"[italic type]Can you imagine the power of a sun? It is fathomless, it is the purest energy. This Orb above - it is like that. And like every sun enlivens the planets around it, so does the Orb on a smaller scale. Frizza - as it is commonly called - is an organism, and the Orbs are its hearts.[paragraph break]"
"Cavern"	"[italic type]It is ancient, and it harbors something even more ancient. You see, if what you see here is the motor, we are merely the droplets, falling of in times of superfluousness.[paragraph break]"

After asking Dunia about "Essence Pool":
	say "[italic type]Now that is something quite particular. However, Du'un is far more suited to tell you about it."
	
After asking Du'un about "Essence Pool" for the first time:
	say "[italic type]You see that Orb there, above? This pool is what it is made of, a special kind of Flux, we call it the Fountain. We will attempt something now. Put both of the Essences in the pool. Start with the Unregulated one." 
After asking Du'un about "Essence Pool" for the second time:
	say "[italic type]Put both of the Essences in the pool first, then we will see."

Instead of inserting the Sinkan Cloak into the Essence Pool:
		say "[roman type]Before you can dip it into the pool you hear a rumbling beside you.[paragraph break][italic type]You shouldn't try that.";

Instead of inserting the Flux Extractor into the Essence Pool:
		say "[roman type]Before you can dip it into the pool you hear a rumbling beside you.[paragraph break][italic type]You shouldn't try that.";
		stop the action.
		
After inserting the Unregulated Flux Essence into the Essence Pool:
		say "You carefully extend the Extractor to drop the sample that you've got from the Flux before the gate into the pool. You hear a muffled[italic type]splash[roman type]. Afterwards, the pool starts swirling, forming thick threads of seemingly solid mass. It encloses the sample in its center and continues to arrange itself in patterns. Finally, with a last compression, it looses the tension and returns to a still state, leaving no sign of the Unregulated Essence. Dunia briefly gives off a comment.[paragraph break][italic type]Now, that was spectacular.";
		remove Unregulated Flux Essence from play.
		
Instead of inserting the Regulated Flux Essence into the Essence Pool:
	if the Unregulated Flux Essence is in the Flux Extractor:
		say "Start with the Unregulated Essence.";
		stop the action;
	else:
		say "As you drop the Regulated Flux Essence from beyond the gate into the Pool, you hear an impressive silence - the sample actually makes no sound at all as it meets the surface. Excited, you stare at the pool. It shows a rash shiver, a quick swirld, before regaining its calm state. Du'un turns to you, his eyes smiling.[paragraph break][italic type]You might want to know - that is a quite good outcome.";
		remove Regulated Flux Essence from play;
		say "[paragraph break]As soon as Du'un finished, the pool again starts to move, first swirling, then seething heavily. The bubbles coming from it become solid in mid-air and drop down again, ghostly arcs of blue smoke emerge from the pool, deep rifts start to form. Unvoluntarily, you take a step back. Just when it seems that the pool would sputter out of its basin the tensions abate, the rifts close and the convulsive motions subside. On turning, you see Du'un holding his staff fixed towards the pool. The last movement goes through the pool, then it falls silent. Suddenly, a small object comes to the surface - a transparent orb with a balanced source of energy inside it: a Pure Flux Orb. [line break]Du'un points his staff in the direction of the orb and lifts it out of the pool, without touching it, right into a glass container that Dunia stands ready with. As soon as the orb is in the container, Dunia seals it, holding it triumphantly. Du'un turns to you.[paragraph break][italic type]That, now, is something special.[paragraph break][roman type]Suddenly you realize that Dunia's cloak isn't in one piece anymore, rather, its matter looks like it melted and solidified again, whole parts of it are missing. Perhaps the direct contact to the Core was too much for it.[paragraph break]You receive a [bold type]Pure Flux Essence.";
		remove the Sinkan Cloak from play;
		now the player has the Pure Flux Essence;
		say "[line break][italic type]Oh, and we will need that back.[paragraph break][roman type]Dunia takes the Flux Extractor from you, smiling cheekily.";

		say "[paragraph break]You start the long ascend, Du'un and Dunia following close behind you. Amazed, you hold the Pure Essence in your hands, aware of its worth.[paragraph break]As you finally reach the Flux Gate you see that the operator and staff guards have changed, you must have been down there quite a while. One last time, Du'un adresses you.[paragraph break][italic type]If you insert that into your ship, you should have enough energy for a few thousand years of space travel. Use it wisely. And farewell.[paragraph break][roman type]And with that he leaves the Gate, this time heading straight to the north, towards the city.[paragraph break][italic type]I couldn't have said it better. Farewell, and be free to look around, should there be a next time, perhaps I will be there.[paragraph break][roman type]Now Dunia too sets out - her in the direction of the ghastly mountains. You stand there, with more energy in your hands than you could ever fathom. It might be time to leave that place.";
		now the player is in the Upper Gate_Frizza.

The description of the Pure Flux Essence is "A transparent orb inside a glass container, its core is an even sphere of pure blue energy. It is more than fit to start you ship back up. You should try inserting it."


[End]

The Discharged Spaceship is inside the Landing Zone_Frizza. The description of the Discharged Spaceship is "Your spaceship, broken down due to power loss. The clouds in the atmosphere may have sped up the discharge."  The Discharged Spaceship is fixed in place.

Instead of inserting anything into the Discharged Spaceship:

You get an even better view of the structures that span the width of the gorge, you are now certain that there is mining equipment and transportation units, some manned and some apparently controlled remotely. You approach the cabin, saving a couple of steps in distance, and try to glance into the inside of the cabin. Someone sits there at a metal desk, wearing a hardhat and sunglasses, between ridiculous heaps of papers and files. In his mouth there is an oblong roll, glowing blue, and on one of the inside wall hangs an oversized metal suit, equipped with all kind of complex-looking gear.

Chapter 5 - Kaldríss

Section 1 - Crash Site

[Finding a way off the space ship]

[Axesto is a person. The Player is Axesto.]

[Spacesuit with energy capacitor]
A spacesuit is a kind of thing. A spacesuit is always wearable. An energy capacitor is a kind of container. The energy capacitor is part of every spacesuit.
The carrying capacity of an energy capacitor is always 1.
The description of the spacesuit is "Spacesuit Mk. XV[paragraph break]Made for deep space travel due to its extraordinary thermodynamic capabilities.[paragraph break]This model also has an energy capacitor built in that needs some kind of energy in order to properly work. The more pure the energy the more effective the suits thermal protection will work.".

After examining the spacesuit for the first time:
	say "After taking a closer look it seems like the suit doesn't have any juice left so you would still freeze pretty quickly after leaving the spaceship. Unless, of course, you find some kind of energy source that fits right in.".

[Warnings for inserting wrong items]
Before inserting protector glove into the energy capacitor:
	say "This glove surely won't work as an energy source.";
	stop the action.	
	
Before inserting emergency torch into the  energy capacitor:
	say "This emergency torch works with a special fuel but the energy capacitor can only ";
	stop the action.
	
Before inserting encryption key into the energy capacitor:
	say "This encryption key wasn't made for this.";
	stop the action.

Before inserting Yarwol's Keystone into the energy capacitor:
	say "There is only one place this keystone would fit.";
	stop the action.

Before inserting the flux essence fragment into the energy capacitor for the first time:
	say "[italic type]Do I really wanna do this? Chances of me dying are quite high. On the other hand, I will probably die anyway. Careful now. And ..[paragraph break]oh no ..[paragraph break]NONONO[paragraph break]WAIT .. EUREKA .. it actually worked![roman type]";
	continue the action.



[Protector Glove/Electricity]
A protector glove is a thing and wearable. The description of the protector glove is "This protector glove is made out of a special  rubber compound that temporarily absorbs any kind of energy thus protecting its wearer. However, it's not recommended handling powerful energy sources over a longer period of time since the absorbtion mechanisms in place become increasingly unstable and might result in a spontanious implosion. Big no-no!"

A thing can be safe or electrified. A thing is usually safe.

This is the electrocution-wisdom rule:
	if the player wears the protector glove, make no decision;
	if the action requires a touchable noun and the noun is electrified, say "You really shouldn't be touching [the noun] without something that protects you from its enormous amounts of energy. This flux essence consists of pure energy and would therefore immediately disintegrate your hand if you touched it without a [bold type]glove[roman type]." instead;

The electrocution-wisdom rule is listed before the basic accessibility rule in the action-processing rules.

After putting on the protector glove for the first time:
	say "This should work!";
	continue the action.

After taking the flux essence fragment for the first time:
	say "This glove truly works wonders. No harm done.".

After going to Yundar's Cave for the first  time:
	say "Upon trying to make your way into the small cave entrance you slipped and went all the way down. Apart from a few scratches here and there you seem to be okay even though your head hurts quite a lot. You can barely see from where you landed but you see light a little further ahead and decide to go there. It's getting easier to see with every step you take and suddenly you hear noises. It sounds like someone is .. talking? You can't really understand what they are saying since it seems to be some ancient language but you heard the words [italic type]Yundar[roman type] and [italic type]Yarwol[roman type] being thrown around a couple of times so maybe those are names? Perhaps it's even humans who live down here. Maybe it's one of the explorers from the camp above you. This would certainly explain where they went. notice outlines of a figure that seems to resemble a human since. The last thing you heard were footsteps heading east."

[Yarwol's Cave]
Yarwol's Cave is a room. "This cave is where Yarwol, the oldest Yetíss, resides. You wonder how many more of these caves exist.

You better drop that negativity and start figuring out how to escape this place." The printed name of Yarwol's Cave is "Cave".

After going to Yarwol's Cave for the first time:
	say "You sneakily followed one of the mysterious creatures. Luckily nobody has noticed you. So far so good. Now it's time to find out how you could get out of here.  You take a look around this cave and notice these suspicious rocks. You can't help but feel like someone is trying to hide something behind them so probably you should try to very carefully shove them aside and see if your suspicions turn out to be true."


[Main Cave]
The Main Cave_Kaldríss is a room. "This is like the central cave that also acts as kind of a hub for all the Yetíss that live inside this cave system. Judging from the sheer size of it there must be hundreds of different caves down here." The printed name of the Main Cave_Kaldríss is "Cave".

After going to the Main Cave_Kaldríss for the first time:
	say "Looks like this is the cave that connects them all which also explains why it's that much bigger than the ones before.  You can also notice a tiny gap in the east wall. Directly next to it is a small hole in the wall that seems to have a very specific shape. It could be some kind of keyhole. If this assumption is true and this turns out to be a door of some kind then this might also be the way out of this cave system.".

[Secret Cave]
Secret Cave_Kaldríss is a room. "A secret cave that even most of the Yetíss don't know about. Only the ones worthy enough are allowed to enter." The printed name of the Secret Cave_Kaldríss is "Cave". 

Before going to Secret Cave_Kaldríss for the first time:
	say "You fumble around with the keystone until it suddenly fits exactly into the hole next to the small gap in the wall. A mechanism activates and the gap begins to widen. As soon as it's wide enough so you can fit through yo go for it hoping that nobody will follow you. Getting past the Yetíss undetected wasn't easy but in the end you managed to do it and now it's finally time to find a way off this planet! I can see a light above me that seems to be leading to .. some place? I should probably follow it before I get lost in the void. [italic type][bold type]Beam me up![roman type]";
